# GATHR SHOP
### Welcome! We are GATHR, a non-traditional fundraising enviornment fostering support for cause-based organizations through unique and locally designed swag. Here we create community and unity around shared causes. Gathr was created through a collaborative effort of socially conscious individuals who wanted to bridge ecommerce and social good.

- Create a profile page that shows liked causes and past purchases.
- Create a goal tracker of how many products sold towards a target goal.
- Show user's total amount spent towards causes.
- Filter the list of causes by cause type.
- Order the products by price.
